  # Crimson Rune Event
  bm_crimson_rune.001.title:0 "Inscribe the Blood Runes"
  bm_crimson_rune.001.desc:0 "You unfurl ancient scrolls depicting intricate patterns of power - blood runes that transform the mage's own body into a vessel for harvesting lifeforce. The ritual requires special needles forged in blood-quenched fire, inks mixed with your own essence, and the steady hand of one who understands that each line is not merely drawn but bound to your very being.\n\nThe pain will be excruciating, the commitment permanent. Yet with each drop of blood and ink merged into your flesh, your connection to the crimson arts will deepen. Such markings are the sign of a blood mage who seeks true mastery - one who becomes not merely a wielder of blood magic, but a living embodiment of it."
