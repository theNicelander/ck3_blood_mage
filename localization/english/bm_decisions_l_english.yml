The old faiths are hollow shells compared to the tangible power offered by the Cult of Blood. Their sacred texts speak of transcendence through sacrifice, of bending the laws of nature through the manipulation of life's crimson currency. Perhaps it is time to abandon the empty promises of old gods and embrace the visceral truth that flows through every living being."

  bm_self_initiation_decision_confirm: "I am my own crucible."
  bm_self_initiation_decision_desc: "The tomes and scrolls offer fragmented clues, but I have no mentor to guide me, no subject to practice upon. The only path forward is the most perilous: to perform the initiation ritual upon myself. I must become both surgeon and patient, sorcerer and sacrifice.\n\nMy own blood will be the medium, my mind the battlefield where I wrestle raw power into submission. There is no dogma here, only dangerous knowledge and the strength of my own will. If I succeed, I will command the very essence of life. If I fail, my mind and body will be the price."
  bm_self_initiation_decision_tooltip: "Use forbidden knowledge to perform an initiation ritual upon yourself. Without a guide, the risks are immense. Failure could shatter your mind or break your body."

  bm_blood_cultist_become_blood_mage_decision_desc: "As a devoted follower of the Cult of Blood, I've witnessed the raw power wielded by our most exalted members. While faith alone has granted me glimpses of blood's true potential, to become a Blood Mage is to transcend mortal limitations. The ritual requires sacrifice—both literal and symbolic—as my body becomes a vessel for ancient power.
