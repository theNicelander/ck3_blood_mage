become_blood_cultist_decision_desc:0 "The whispers have grown too persistent to ignore. Tales of immortality, of power drawn from the very essence of life itself. The old faiths are hollow shells compared to the tangible power offered by the Cult of Blood. Their sacred texts speak of transcendence through sacrifice, of bending the laws of nature through the manipulation of life's crimson currency. Perhaps it is time to abandon the empty promises of old gods and embrace the visceral truth that flows through every living being."

While faith alone has granted me glimpses of blood's true potential, to become a Blood Mage is to transcend mortal limitations. The ritual requires sacrifice—both literal and symbolic—as my body becomes a vessel for ancient power. The transition will be agonizing, but those who emerge from the crimson baptism gain mastery over life itself. The time has come to evolve from worshipper to wielder."
