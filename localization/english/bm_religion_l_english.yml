  cult_of_blood_desc: "The Cult of Blood practices an ancient and forbidden form of magic that harnesses the vital essence of living beings. Adherents believe that blood is the ultimate currency of power—containing memories, traits, and life itself. Through rituals of sacrifice and communion, Blood Cultists extend their lives, absorb traits from others, and manipulate reality through carefully cultivated lifeforce. Their faith is structured around holy sites scattered throughout Europe, each serving as a nexus for arcane power. While reviled by conventional religions as abominable heretics, Blood Cultists see themselves as transcending mortal limitations, pursuing a path to immortality through the crimson arts that conventional faiths dare not acknowledge."
