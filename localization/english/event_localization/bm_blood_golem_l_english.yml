  blood_golem.001.title: "The Birth of Blood and Clay"
  blood_golem.001.desc: "The ritual circle is complete, drawn in your own blood mixed with rare alchemical substances. At its center stands a roughly humanoid figure molded from red clay, river silt, and bone dust. As you speak the final words of the incantation, blood flows from your outstretched hands into the clay figure.\n\nAt first, nothing happens. Then, a tremor runs through the clay form. Cracks appear across its surface, leaking a faint crimson light. The figure shifts, clay reshaping itself into more defined human features. Slowly, joints bend, fingers flex, and finally, eyelids carved from clay open to reveal glowing crimson orbs.\n\nThe blood golem takes its first stumbling step, then kneels before you. Though its mouth doesn't move, you hear its voice directly in your mind—a whisper made of your own blood, now given consciousness.\n\n\"Creator... I live to serve.\""
