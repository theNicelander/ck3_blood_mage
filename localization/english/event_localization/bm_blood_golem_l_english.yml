  blood_golem.001.title: "The Birth of Blood and Clay"
  blood_golem.001.desc: "The ritual circle is complete, drawn in your own blood mixed with rare alchemical substances. At its center stands a roughly humanoid figure molded from red clay, river silt, and bone dust. As you speak the final words of the incantation, blood flows from your outstretched hands into the clay figure.\n\nAt first, nothing happens. Then, a tremor runs through the clay form. Cracks appear across its surface, leaking a faint crimson light. The figure shifts, clay reshaping itself into more defined human features. Slowly, joints bend, fingers flex, and finally, eyelids carved from clay open to reveal glowing crimson orbs.\n\nThe blood golem takes its first stumbling step, then kneels before you. Though its mouth doesn't move, you hear its voice directly in your mind—a whisper made of your own blood, now given consciousness.\n\n\"Creator... I live to serve.\""

  blood_golem_creation_decision_desc: "The ancient tomes speak of servants crafted from earth and animated by the essence of life itself. Through a complex ritual requiring significant magical power, you can bind your own lifeforce to an artificial form—creating a loyal servant whose very existence is tied to your blood. This blood golem will serve as both guardian and tool, an extension of your will with capabilities far beyond those of mortal servants. Though the ritual drains considerable vitality, the creation of such a being marks you as a true master of hematurgy, capable of bestowing the gift of consciousness through blood magic."
