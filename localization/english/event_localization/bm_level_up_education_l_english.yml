  enhance_education_decision_confirm: "Infuse my blood with ancient wisdom"
  enhance_education_decision_tooltip: "Use forbidden blood magic to enhance your education and expand your mental capabilities beyond normal limits"
  enhance_education_decision_desc: "The crimson arts offer pathways to knowledge that conventional scholars could never imagine. By infusing your brain with magically-enhanced blood, you can unlock forgotten memories, strengthen neural pathways, and absorb understanding that would take decades to master through traditional study. The ritual requires significant sacrifice—your own vitality and essence must be channeled into the transformation of mind. As your educational foundations strengthen through blood magic, further enhancements become increasingly difficult, requiring greater power and precision. The greatest blood mages are not merely powerful—they are tremendously skilled and knowledgeable in ways that defy mortal comprehension."
  enhance_education_decision_tt: "You attempt to improve one of your education traits"

############### Get new education
  # Decision
  new_education_decision: "Embrace New Knowledge"
  new_education_decision_confirm: "Reshape my mind with forbidden wisdom"
  new_education_decision_tooltip: "Use blood magic to forge new neural pathways and gain an education in a discipline you haven't mastered"
  new_education_decision_desc: "While ordinary scholars spend decades trying to master a secondary field of study, blood magic offers a faster—if more dangerous—alternative. Through a forbidden ritual that rewires the very structure of your mind, you can absorb the essence of knowledge typically gained through years of dedicated study. Unlike enhancing existing expertise, creating entirely new pathways of understanding requires profound magical force—your blood must be completely altered to accommodate an entirely separate discipline. The ritual's success depends on both your magical potency and your mind's receptivity to radical transformation. Should you survive with your sanity intact, you will emerge with capabilities beyond those of even the most accomplished conventional scholars."
  new_education_decision_tt: "Gain an education trait in a discipline you haven't mastered yet"

  # Event title and description
  bm_education_new.001.title: "Forging New Neural Pathways"
  bm_education_new.001.desc: "Ancient tomes open before you as you prepare the ritual space. Unlike your previous work enhancing existing knowledge, this endeavor requires breaking down mental barriers and creating entirely new structures of understanding. The crimson runes you've painted on your temples pulse with anticipation—they will serve as conduits for knowledge to flood directly into your consciousness. Which unfamiliar discipline will you force your mind to embrace today?"
