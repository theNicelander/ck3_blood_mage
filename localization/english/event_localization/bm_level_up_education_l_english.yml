  enhance_education_decision_desc: "The crimson arts offer pathways to knowledge that conventional scholars could never imagine. By infusing your brain with magically-enhanced blood, you can unlock forgotten memories, strengthen neural pathways, and absorb understanding that would take decades to master through traditional study. The ritual requires significant sacrifice—your own vitality and essence must be channeled into the transformation of mind. As your educational foundations strengthen through blood magic, further enhancements become increasingly difficult, requiring greater power and precision. The greatest blood mages are not merely powerful—they are tremendously skilled and knowledgeable in ways that defy mortal comprehension."
