  # Event Descriptions
  seek_power.001.desc: "The wilderness beyond your settlement pulses with life energy. Ancient trees reach toward the sky, their roots drinking deep from soil enriched by countless cycles of death and rebirth. As you venture deeper into nature's domain, you feel the primal power of blood magic growing stronger, drawing you toward potential sacrifices that might feed your arcane hunger."
  seek_power.002.desc: "Your hunt leads you to a magnificent stag, its breath creating clouds of mist in the cold air. The creature stands proud, unaware of your approach as you prepare your ritual. Blood magic requires no bow or blade—just your will and the ancient words of power. As you begin the incantation, you feel the connection forming between your essence and the animal's life force."
  seek_power.003.desc: "Deep in the wilderness, far from any path, you encounter a solitary figure. Dressed in tattered clothes and trembling from exposure, the traveler appears to have lost their way days ago. Gaunt and weakened, they look up at your approach with both hope and fear in their eyes. Despite their pitiable state, you sense something valuable that others would overlook—life essence ripe for the taking... or perhaps a chance to demonstrate mercy through your arcane gifts."
  seek_power.004.desc: "Deep within the primal forest, where sunlight rarely filters through the thick canopy, you discover an aberration of nature—a massive oak tree unlike any you've ever seen. Its trunk, wide as a castle wall, pulses with visible rhythm. Ancient runes are carved into its bark, their meanings lost to time.\n\nWhen you place your hand upon its surface, it's warm like flesh. You feel drawn to make a small cut in the bark, and to your astonishment, crimson sap that looks and smells exactly like blood begins to flow freely. It's not just tree sap—this ancient sentinel has absorbed the essence of thousands of creatures over centuries, creating a nexus of pure life energy.\n\nAs your fingers touch the crimson liquid, visions flood your mind—ancient beasts, forgotten civilizations, and secrets buried by time. This tree has witnessed everything, its roots reaching deep into the heart of the world itself. Such power could fuel your magic beyond measure, but taking too much might anger whatever primordial force sustains this marvel."
