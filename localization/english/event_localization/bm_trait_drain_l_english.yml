  bm_trait_drain.001.title: "The Essence Harvest"
  bm_trait_drain.001.desc: "The prisoner kneels before you, terror evident in their wide eyes as crimson runes flicker to life on the chamber floor. Their pleas for mercy fade to whispers as you approach, your fingers tracing arcane patterns in the air. You can sense what makes them special—that spark of intelligence, that physical prowess, that uncanny beauty—pulsing beneath their skin like a beacon calling to your power.\n\nBlood magic requires sacrifice, and their unique gifts will soon become yours. The air grows thick with anticipation as tendrils of your consciousness reach out, preparing to extract what you desire. Their lips quiver, forming desperate words:\n\n\"Please... anything but this...\"\n\nBut you know better. Their essence will serve you far more effectively than their flesh ever could."
