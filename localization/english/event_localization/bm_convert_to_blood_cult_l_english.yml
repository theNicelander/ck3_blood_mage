  bm_convert_to_blood_cult.001.desc: "The crimson light of dusk filters through the chamber windows as you prepare the ritual space. Ancient symbols drawn in your own blood adorn the floor, their meaning obscure to any but the initiated. Your target kneels before you, eyes wide with fear and fascination as you explain the truths hidden from ordinary folk—that power flows in the veins of all living things, that immortality is possible through sacrifice, that the old gods are mere shadows of the primal force that is blood itself.\n\nTo complete their conversion, you must bind their essence to yours in a sacred exchange. Their blood will taste your magic, and their soul will be forever altered."

  bm_convert_to_blood_cult.001.a: "Embrace the crimson path, and I shall guide you"
