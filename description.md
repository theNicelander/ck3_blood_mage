This Blood Mage mod strives to incorporate low-fantasy magic into CK3 in a balanced way. The mod doesn't overwrite any base game files, so it should be compatible with all mods. 

Ever wanted to have a way for your character to live forever, without being completely immortal? Ever wanted for your playable character to be able to gain positive physical traits (intelligent, beautiful) in a way that feels part of the game?

Then this mod is for you.  

[h1] Blood Mage [/h1]

Dashboard: https://share.streamlit.io/thenicelander/ck3_blood_mage_viz/main

The Blood Mage trait comes in 9 levels. Only the first, Blood Mage Initiate, can be selected at the start. The remaining 8 have to be earned by levelling up. 

You can also gain the initial trait by asking your blood mage friend/lover/soulmate to grant you the power or by becoming a witch and converting to a Blood Mage. 

[h1] So what can Blood Mages do? [/h1]

Blood Mages have magic flowing through their veins, and this magic can be made increasingly powerful. This power  extends a Blood Mage's life and allows them to cast increasingly powerful spells and become more proficient at the spells they know already. 

Blood Mages rely on piety and a new [b]Lifeforce[/b] modifier to cast spells. 

[h1]Lifeforce [/h1]

Lifeforce is the fundamental power of Blood Mages. It can be violently extracted from other human beings. 

By itself, Lifeforce prolongs your life or it can be expended to cast spells such as:

[list]
    [*] Transfer Lifeforce to others
    [*] Cure wounds and illnesses. The more severe the illness, the higher the blood mage trait required to cast it. 
    [*] Drain traits from others (such as Intelligent, Beautiful, Giant, Robust). The higher your learning and Blood Mage trait, the more successful you'll be (see Dashboard for details)
    [*] Increase your Blood Potency (increasing the Blood Mage trait rank)
    [*] Increasing the Blood Mage power of your dynasty
    [*] Increase your skill temporarily (+5 for 5 years)
    [*] Increase your skill permanently (+1)
    [*] Grant others Blood Magic (the rank depends on your rank)
[/list]

[h1]Cult of Blood - New faith[/h1]

Blood Mages can optionally follow their own unreformed religion, that's hated by the rest of the world, making playing as one even harder.

Places of power (holy sites) exist across Europe, in most many major cities. However, the bonuses are small each time, in attempt to balance out the number of sites.

[h1]Resources[/h1]

Absorbing traits and levelling up follow a formula that depends on many factors, such as the number of traits you already have, your learning, your target's learning and your Blood Mage Level.

It's easiest to understand by visualising how it works. Which is exactly what I've done, by creating this interactive dashboard:
