You feel drawn to make a small cut in the bark, and to your astonishment, crimson sap that looks and smells exactly like blood begins to flow freely. It's not just tree sap—this ancient sentinel has absorbed the essence of thousands of creatures over centuries, creating a nexus of pure life energy.\n\nAs your fingers touch the crimson liquid, visions flood your mind—ancient beasts, forgotten civilizations, and secrets buried by time. This tree has witnessed everything, its roots reaching deep into the heart of the world itself. Such power could fuel your magic beyond measure, but taking too much might anger whatever primordial force sustains this marvel."
