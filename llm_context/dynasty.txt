## Renown System

### Core Mechanics
- **Renown**: Main resource for dynasties used for powerful Dynasty Head interactions, unlocking legacies, and increasing Splendor level
- **Accumulation**: Each living dynasty member contributes renown based on their rank
- **Caps**: Renown gain from non-rulers capped at +2 (100 members); Dynasty Head prestige gain capped at +3; House Head prestige gain capped at +5
