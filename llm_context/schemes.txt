# CK3 Schemes System Reference

## Core Scheme Mechanics

Every scheme in CK3 operates on two fundamental values:

- **Success Chance**: Determines likelihood of scheme success when executed; grows over time
- **Phase Length**: Controls scheme progression speed
  - For Personal schemes: Time until completion
  - For Hostile/Political schemes: Time to gain Advantage

### Hostile and Political Scheme Values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Potential** | Maximum Success Chance (capped at 95%, except contracts)<br>- Schemer skills provide up to 30% Potential<br>- Remaining Potential comes from agents |
| **Secrecy** | Likelihood of scheme remaining undetected<br>- Discovery chance on execution = missing Secrecy<br>- Monthly Breach chance = 1/10 of missing Secrecy<br>- Inactive during Grace period (6 months, 10 months with Court of Shadows perk) |
| **Breaches** | Count of times scheme has been discovered<br>- Reduces Success Chance<br>- At 5 Breaches: automatic scheme failure |
| **Advantage** | Resources for scheme execution or agent enticement<br>- Can execute scheme at 5+ Advantage<br>- Higher execution thresholds (10/15/20) increase Success Chance<br>- Starting Advantage = 1 per 5 points of Intrigue above 15 |

### Scheme Targeting Restrictions
- Cannot target own children with hostile schemes (except with Sadistic trait)
- At war penalties: -50 Success Chance for Murder, -200 for Abduction

## Hostile Schemes

## Agent Mechanics

Agents can significantly affect a scheme's chance of success. Different types have distinct effects:

### Swaying Agents
- Involves characters that can help in the scheme
- All schemes have a base Swaying Chance depending on the scheme type
- **Acceptance Bonus Factors**:
  - Opinion +0.5 per point
  - Traits (Content: -10, Brave: +10, etc.)
  - Convinced by Hook: Weak +10, Strong +20
  - Direct bribe from 0-10 depending on Greed

### Scheme Potential Agents
- Affects maximum Success Chance
- **Contribution factors**:
  - Agent Skill +1 per 3 points
  - Agent relevance (Physician for Murder: +3, etc.)
  - Agent position (Spouse: +5, etc.)
  - Agent Opinion of schemer +0.05 per point

### Administrative Agents
- Only for Political schemes
- Base contribution based on family rank and position
- Additional bonuses from skills and traits

### Phase Length and Secrecy Agents
- Affect how quickly scheme progresses and how secret it remains
- Based on agent skills, traits, and relationship to target

### Countermeasure Focus
- Defensive actions to protect against hostile schemes
- +30% chance to discover schemes against self
- +20% chance to discover schemes against spouse
- +15% chance to discover schemes against court and others
