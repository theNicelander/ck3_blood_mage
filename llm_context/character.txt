# CK3 Character Opinion System - Reference Guide

## Core Opinion Mechanics
- Each character has an opinion of every other character, affecting interactions and behavior
- Player character's opinion affects success rates of actions targeting other characters
- AI characters' opinions determine their behavior toward other characters
