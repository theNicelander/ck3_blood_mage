# CK3 Trait Inheritance System Reference

## Basic Inheritance Mechanics

CK3 uses a sophisticated genetic system with active (visible) and inactive (hidden) traits. Characters can inherit traits from their parents or gain them through random chance based on natural prevalence.

## Active Trait Inheritance

The probability of a child inheriting a trait as active (visible with effects) depends on the parents' trait status:

| Mother \ Father | None    | Inactive | Active  |
|-----------------|---------|----------|---------|
| None            | 0%      | 2%       | 25%     |
| Inactive        | 2%      | 10%      | 50%     |
| Active          | 25%     | 50%      | 80%     |

## Inactive Trait Inheritance

If a trait isn't inherited actively, there's still a chance to inherit it as inactive (hidden but can be passed to future generations):

| Mother \ Father | None    | Inactive | Active  |
|-----------------|---------|----------|---------|
| None            | 0%      | 25%      | 75%     |
| Inactive        | 25%     | 50%      | 100%    |
| Active          | 75%     | 100%     | 150%    |

## Tiered Trait Inheritance Logic

For multi-level traits (like beauty or intelligence tiers), the inheritance follows this algorithm:

1. Start from highest tier present in parents
2. Calculate active inheritance chance (lower tiers count as inactive of the highest tier)
3. Each level below the highest reduces chance by a factor (defined in game code)
4. If trait becomes active, use that tier; otherwise:
5. Go down one tier level and recalculate with modified parent counts
   - If previous tier was inactive, count as one more parent with active
   - Otherwise, count as one more parent with inactive

When inheriting from a parent with a lower tier:
- System treats it as if they have the higher tier recessively
- Reduces inheritance chance by 20% per tier difference beyond the first
- When going down a tier, add 40% to inheritance chance

## Trait Inheritance Modifiers

Several modifiers affect trait inheritance probability:
- **Strong Blood**: +40% chance of inheriting positive traits, +400% natural prevalence
- **Blood Legacy Tier 1**: +30% chance of positive traits
- **Blood Legacy Tier 3**: -30% chance of negative/mixed traits
- **Blood Legacy Tier 4**: Increases chance for selected traits to become more prevalent

## Congenital Traits List

Natural prevalence percentages for all congenital traits (chance of random appearance at birth):

### Mental Traits (Initially Hidden)
- **Melancholic**: 0.5% (activates between 10-13.75 years)
- **Lunatic**: 0.5% (activates between 16-30 years)
- **Possessed**: 0.5% (activates between 10-20 years)

### Physical Tier Traits
| Group | Negative Tiers | Prevalence | Positive Tiers | Prevalence |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Beauty | Homely (-1) | 0.5% | Comely (+1) | 0.5% |
|        | Ugly (-2) | 0.25% | Pretty/Handsome (+2) | 0.25% |
|        | Hideous (-3) | 0.15% | Beautiful (+3) | 0.15% |
| Intelligence | Slow (-1) | 0.5% | Quick (+1) | 0.5% |
|              | Stupid (-2) | 0.25% | Intelligent (+2) | 0.25% |
|              | Imbecile (-3) | 0.05% | Genius (+3) | 0.05% |
| Physique | Delicate (-1) | 0.5% | Hale (+1) | 0.5% |
|          | Frail (-2) | 0.25% | Robust (+2) | 0.25% |
|          | Feeble (-3) | 0.15% | Amazonian/Herculean (+3) | 0.15% |

### Other Congenital Traits
- **Fecund**: 0% at birth
- **Club-footed**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Hunchbacked**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Lisping**: 0.5%
- **Stuttering**: 0.5%
- **Dwarf**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Giant**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Spindly**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Scaly**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Albino**: 0.5%
- **Wheezing**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Bleeder**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)
- **Barren/Sterile**: 0.5% (also from inbreeding)

## Special Inheritance Traits

| Trait | Single Parent Chance | Both Parents Chance | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Great Pox | 10% | - | STD |
| Lover's Pox | 10% | - | STD |
| Pure-blooded | 15% | 75% | Initially from inbreeding |
| Inbred | 15% | - | Initially from inbreeding |
| Sayyid | 100% | - | Only from apparent father |
| Saoshyant/Descendant | 100% | - | Descendant when parent is Saoshyant |
| Paragon/Consecrated Blood | 100% | - | Consecrated when parent is Paragon |
| The Savior/Divine Blood | 100% | - | Divine Blood when parent is The Savior |

## Inbreeding Mechanics

### Common Ancestor Impact

The chance of inbreeding effects depends on:
- **Number of common ancestors** within 4 generations
- **Inbreeding factor** (relatedness coefficient Ã— 0.3)

#### Example Relatedness Values:
- Full siblings: 30 common ancestors (maximum possible)
- Parent-child: 15 common ancestors
- Half-siblings: 15 common ancestors
- First cousins: 14 common ancestors
- Uncle-niece/aunt-nephew: 14 common ancestors
- Second cousins: 6 common ancestors
- Third cousins: 2 common ancestors

#### Inbreeding Chances By Relation:
- Siblings: 15% chance (50% relatedness coefficient)
- Half-siblings: 7.5% chance (25% relatedness coefficient)

### Pure-blooded Effect

The Pure-blooded trait reduces inbreeding chance by 50% per parent:
- One parent: -50% chance of inbreeding effects
- Both parents: No chance of inbreeding effects (except natural trait prevalence)

### Traits From Inbreeding

When inbreeding occurs, offspring may gain these traits (if parents don't have them):
- Barren/Sterile
- Scaly
- Club-footed
- Wheezing
- Spindly
- Giant
- Hunchbacked
- Bleeder
- Dwarf

Additionally, the Inbred trait may be gained if a character with any general inbred trait has children with someone sharing a common ancestor. Pure-blooded may be gained as a rare positive outcome of inbreeding.

## Base Calculations for Modding

- Parents with no genetic traits still have a 12.7% chance to have a child with congenital traits:
  - 2.6% positive traits
  - 10.1% mixed/negative traits

- The "Strong Blood" modifier increases natural prevalence of positive traits by 400%
- The Blood Legacy can further modify these chances:
  - Tier 1: +30% chance of positive traits
  - Tier 3: -30% chance of negative/mixed traits
