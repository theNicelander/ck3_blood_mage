# CK3 Blood Mage Mod

This mod is for you if:

- You love playing a single character
- You want a way for your character to live forever, without being completely immortal
- You want your character to gain positive physical traits (intelligent, beautiful, etc) in a way that feels part of the game

**Maximum compatibility**: Doesn't overwrite any base game files to work with most other mods, even large overhaul mods such as EK2 or AGOT (tested).

## Blood Mage Trait and Specialisation

The Blood Mage trait features five unique specialisation tracks:

- **Ancient**: Master longevity and defy aging
- **Enlightenment**: Enhance personal magical power and potential  
- **Bloodline**: Strengthen your dynasty through blood magic
- **Benediction**: Perfect healing and enhancement of others
- **Hematurgy**: Absorb traits and harvest lifeforce from the unworthy

Each track gains experience as you use related abilities, with progressive tiers providing escalating benefits like increased lifespan, skill bonuses, and exclusive abilities.

## Lifeforce System

Lifeforce is the fundamental resource for Blood Mages, and can be:
- Violently extracted from other human beings
- Manifested directly through powerful rituals
- Passively generated through Blood Runes
- Found in nature by seeking power

Two types exist:
- **Minor Lifeforce**: Smaller bonuses, used for less potent magic
- **Major Lifeforce**: Significant bonuses, required for powerful rituals

Both provide:
- Extended lifespan and fertility years
- Disease resistance and health
- Physical prowess

**Blood Mages are NOT immortal** - they can still be assassinated, killed in combat or by illness if their lifeforce becomes depleted.
