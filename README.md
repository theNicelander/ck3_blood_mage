# CK3 Blood Mage Mod

This mod is for you if:

- You love playing a single character
- You want a way for your character to live forever, without being completely immortal
- You want your character to gain and level up positive physical traits (intelligent, beautiful, etc) in a way that feels part of the game

**Maximum compatibility**: Doesn't overwrite any base game files to work with most other mods, even large overhaul mods such as EK2 or AGOT (tested).

## Overview

They drain **Lifeforce** from others to extend their own lifespan and cast powerful spells. This power can be used to heal, enhance abilities, absorb traits, and more, at the cost of their own health.

## Blood Mage Trait and Specialisation

The Blood Mage trait features five distinct tracks:

- **Ancient**: Survive
- **Enlightenment**: Strengthen yourself  
- **Bloodline**: Strengthen your dynasty
- **Benediction**: Healing and strengthen others
- **Hematurgy**: Absorb traits and harvest lifeforce

Each track gains experience as you use related abilities, with ten progressive tiers of power. Maxing them all out might take you over 100 years, costing tens of thousands of piety, and the benefits reflect that. 

## Lifeforce System

Lifeforce is the fundamental resource for Blood Mages, that's primarily gained through draining other characters, such as prisoners or courtiers. Other ways do exist, but you'll have to discover those.

Two types exist:
- **Minor Lifeforce**: Smaller bonuses, used for less potent magic
- **Major Lifeforce**: Significant bonuses, required for powerful rituals

Both provide increased lifespan, fertility, disease resistance, health and prowess. 

Using magic uses up Lifeforce, and grants a temporary negative Lifeforce modifier. This means **Blood Mages are NOT immortal** - they can still be assassinated, killed in combat or by illness if their lifeforce becomes depleted. 

You need to manage your Lifeforce. Balance health and lifespan VS short term gain
