# CK3 Blood Mage Mod

This mod incorporates low-fantasy blood magic into CK3 in a balanced, immersive way. Play as a powerful Blood Mage who harnesses life essence to extend their lifespan, gain supernatural abilities, and even absorb traits from others.

**Maximum compatibility**: This mod doesn't overwrite any base game files, ensuring it works alongside other mods.

## Blood Mage Trait and Progression

The Blood Mage trait now features a progression system with four distinct specialization tracks:

- **Enlightenment**: Focus on personal power and knowledge
- **Bloodline**: Strengthen your dynasty through blood magic
- **Benediction**: Master healing and enhancement of others
- **Hematurgy**: Perfect the art of draining lifeforce and traits

Each track gains experience (1 XP/year baseline) as you use related abilities, with higher ranks providing escalating benefits like increased lifespan, skill bonuses, and special abilities.

## Lifeforce System

Lifeforce is the fundamental resource of Blood Mages, available in two tiers:

- **Minor Lifeforce**: Smaller bonuses, used for less powerful abilities
- **Major Lifeforce**: Significant bonuses, required for powerful magic

Both provide:
- Extended lifespan and fertility years
- Disease resistance
- Physical prowess
- Health bonuses

**Blood mages are NOT immortal** - they can still be killed in combat or succumb to illness if their lifeforce is depleted.
