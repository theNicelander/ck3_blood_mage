[h1]Overview[/h1]
Blood Mages drain [b]Lifeforce[/b] from others to extend their own lifespan and cast powerful spells. This power can be used to heal, enhance abilities, absorb traits, and more, at the cost of their own health.

[h3]Therefore, this mod is for you if:[/h3] 
[list]
    [*] You love playing a [b]single character[/b]
    [*] You want your character to [b]live a long time[/b], without being completely immortal
    [*] You want your character to gain and level up [b]positive physical traits[/b] (intelligent, beautiful, etc) in a way that feels part of the game
    [*] You want the AI to have the same abilities as you do
    [*] You like mods that don't overwrite any base game files, so are [b]maximum compatible[/b] with other mods, even overhaul mods like AGOT / EK2 / PoD / LOTR
[/list]

[h1]Blood Mage Trait and Specialisation[/h1]
The Blood Mage trait features five distinct tracks, each gaining experience as you use related abilities
[list]
    [*] [b]Ancient[/b]: Gain XP yearly
    [*] [b]Enlightenment[/b]: Gain XP by casting blood magic on yourself
    [*] [b]Bloodline[/b]: Gain XP by enhancing your dynasty, or yearly based on dynasty modifiers
    [*] [b]Benediction[/b]: Gain XP by healing ailments and granting powers to others
    [*] [b]Hematurgy[/b]: Gain XP by draining [b]Lifeforce[/b] and harvesting traits from others
[/list]
Each track has ten progressive tiers of power. Maxing them all out might take you 100 years, costing tens of thousands of piety, and the benefits reflect that.

[h1]Lifeforce System[/h1]
[b]Lifeforce[/b] is the fundamental resource for Blood Mages, that's primarily gained through draining other characters, such as prisoners or courtiers. Other ways do exist, but you'll have to discover those.

Using magic uses up Lifeforce, and grants a temporary negative [b]Lifeforce[/b] modifier. 

This means [b]Blood Mages are NOT immortal[/b]. They can still be assassinated, killed in combat or by illness. 

Managing [b]Lifeforce[/b] therfore requires careful balance between health and longevity versus short term power gains.

[h3]Lifeforce comes in two levels[/h3]
Both provide increased lifespan, fertility, disease resistance, health and prowess.
[list]
    [*] [b]Minor Lifeforce[/b]: Smaller bonuses, used for less potent magic
    [*] [b]Major Lifeforce[/b]: Significant bonuses, required for powerful rituals
[/list]

[h1]Blood Magic Abilities[/h1]
Blood Mages can use this Lifeforce to perform various actions:
[list]
    [*] Level up a unique Crimson Empowerment trait, for permanent buffs
    [*] Get temporary buffs, or buff their dynasty permanently
    [*] Improve education trait, or gain new ones
    [*] Inscribe their body with runes that passively generate [b]Lifeforce[/b]
    [*] Heal some wounds and illnesses of varying severity
    [*] Make others Blood Mages or convert to The Cult of Blood (religion)
    [*] Restore Lifedrained characters
    [*] Empower their knights with blood magic
    [*] Create Blood Golems, and enhance their traits at the cost of piety
    [*] Drain congenital traits from prisoners (beauty, intelligence, physique, giant, fecund)
[/list]

[h1]The Cult of Blood[/h1]
Blood Mages can follow their own unique faith, the Cult of Blood:
[list]
    [*] [b]Holy Sites[/b]: Almost 50 locations across Europe
    [*] [b]Special Bonuses[/b]: Each site grants +1 to skills, to balance the number of sites
    [*] [b]Blood Magic University[/b]: Build special duchy buildings to enhance magical study
    [*] [b]Christian Syncretism[/b] allows Blood Cultists to live their pagan ways without being hated by their Christian neighbours.

Note: A known bug is that reforming the faith causes the Blood Cultist decisions/interactions to fail and you cannot select the same icon. For now I recommend not doing this but I'm planning fix this in a future update.

[/list]

[h1]Getting Started[/h1]
There are various ways to gain the Blood Mage trait
[list]
    [*] Select the Blood Mage trait at character creation
    [*] Ask a Blood Mage friend/lover/soulmate to grant you the power
    [*] Convert from being a witch to a Blood Mage (not AI, so other witches can exist)
    [*] Join the Cult of Blood and complete the transformation ritual
    [*] Consume other Blood Mages you've imprisoned
    [*] AI is randomly born with it (same chance as Comely/Quick/Hale)
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
The mod doesn't overwrite any base game files, so it should be compatible with most other mods. It's save game compatible, so can be added anytime.

Mod has been tested with the following mods on 1.15/1.16: A Game of Thrones (AGOT) / LotR: Realms in Exile / Elder Kings 2 (EK2) / Princes of Darkness (PoD)
