This mod is for you if:

- You love playing a single character
- You want a way for your character to live forever, without being completely immortal
- You want your character to gain and level up positive physical traits (intelligent, beautiful, etc) in a way that feels part of the game

The mod doesn't overwrite any base game files, so it should be compatible with most other mods.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Blood Mages drain [b]Lifeforce[/b] from others to extend their own lifespan and cast powerful spells. This power can be used to heal, enhance abilities, absorb traits, and more, at the cost of their own health.

[h1]Blood Mage Trait and Specialisation[/h1]
The Blood Mage trait features five distinct tracks:

- [b]Ancient[/b]: Survive
- [b]Enlightenment[/b]: Strengthen yourself  
- [b]Bloodline[/b]: Strengthen your dynasty
- [b]Benediction[/b]: Healing and strengthen others
- [b]Hematurgy[/b]: Absorb traits and harvest lifeforce

Each track gains experience as you use related abilities, with ten progressive tiers of power. Maxing them all out might take you 100 years, costing tens of thousands of piety, and the benefits reflect that.

[h1]Lifeforce System[/h1]
Lifeforce is the fundamental resource for Blood Mages, that's primarily gained through draining other characters, such as prisoners or courtiers. Other ways do exist, but you'll have to discover those.

Two types exist:
- [b]Minor Lifeforce[/b]: Smaller bonuses, used for less potent magic
- [b]Major Lifeforce[/b]: Significant bonuses, required for powerful rituals

Both provide increased lifespan, fertility, disease resistance, health and prowess.

Using magic uses up Lifeforce, and grants a temporary negative Lifeforce modifier. This means [b]Blood Mages are NOT immortal[/b] - they can still be assassinated, killed in combat or by illness if their lifeforce becomes depleted.

Managing Lifeforce requires careful balance between health and longevity versus short-term power gains.

[h1]Blood Magic Abilities[/h1]
Blood Mages can use this Lifeforce to perform various actions:

[list]
    [*] Level up a unique Crimson Empowerment trait, for permanent buffs
    [*] Get temporary buffs, or buff their dynasty permanently
    [*] Improve education trait, or gain new ones
    [*] Inscribe their body with runes that passively generate lifeforce
    [*] Heal some wounds and illnesses of varying severity
    [*] Make others Blood Mages or convert to the Blood Cult
    [*] Restore those who have been drained
    [*] Empower their knights with blood magic
    [*] Create Blood Golems, and enhance their traits at the cost of piety
    [*] Drain congenital traits from prisoners (beauty, intelligence, physique, giant, fecund)
[/list]

[h1]The Cult of Blood[/h1]
Blood Mages can follow their own unique faith, the Cult of Blood:

- [b]Holy Sites[/b]: Almost 50 locations across Europe
- [b]Special Bonuses[/b]: Each site grants +1 to skills, to balance the number of sites
- [b]Blood Magic University[/b]: Build special duchy buildings to enhance magical study

[h1]Getting Started[/h1]
1. Select the Blood Mage trait at character creation
2. Alternatively:
   - Ask a Blood Mage friend/lover/soulmate to grant you the power
   - Convert from being a witch to a Blood Mage
   - Join the Cult of Blood and complete the transformation ritual
